      Let's include jQuery on our page!
      jQuery is a Javascript library that makes it easier to work with JSON and HTML.

    <!--
      First, let's create a layout for our page.
    -->
    <h1>Providence 2017 Motor Vehicle Tax Roll</h1>
    <h2>The number of cars per production year</h2>
    <ul id='listOfData'>
      <!--
        This is where we will print our data, once we've finished loading it and processing it.
        We'll create a list of bullet points, where each bullet point looks like this:
        <li>Some data</li>
      -->
    </ul>


    <!--
      Okay, we've finished creating our layout.
      Now let's write a function that describes how we want to fill in that layout after we load our data.
      We'll call this function `processData`.
    -->
    <script>
      // What do we want to do once we load the data?
      function processData(data){
        // The `data` variable is an array of all the information that we loaded

        // Let's print the total number of records that we loaded to the browser console
        // Printing things to the console can be useful for debugging (e.g. "Did we actually load any records?")
        console.log(`Processing ${data.length} records...`);

        // Let's keep track of the total number of registered cars per production year (e.g. an '03 Ford Taurus)
        // To do this, we'll create an empty Javascript object
        var carsByYear = {};

        // Now let's iterate through each individual car in our dataset
        // `for (... of ...)` is an easy way to go through an ARRAY (e.g. [1, 2, 3]) item-by-item
        for (item of data) {
          // Each car has an attribute called `year_make` that looks like this: "17 FORD"
          // We want to split that attribute into two parts: the year, and the make.

          var yearAndMake = item.year_make.split(" ");  // This turns "17 FORD" into ["17", "FORD"]
          var year = yearAndMake[0];                    // Get the first item in the array, i.e. "17"
          var make = yearAndMake[1];                    // Get the second item in the array, i.e. "FORD"

          // Now we know what year this car was made in! Let's add it to the totals in carsByYear.
          // If this is the first car that we've seen w/ this year, let's set carsByYear[year] to an initial value of 1.
          // Otherwise, we'll increase the existing tally for that year by 1.
          if (carsByYear[year] == undefined) {
            carsByYear[year] = 1;
          } else {
            carsByYear[year] = carsByYear[year] + 1;
          }
        }

        // Now we have a Javascript object (`carsByYear`) that knows the total number of registered cars by year!
        // Let's iterate through each key-and-value in carsByYear and print out our results.
        // `for (... in ...)` is an easy way to go through an OBJECT (e.g. {"plate_no": "123456"}) item-by-item
        for (year in carsByYear) {
          // This jQuery command finds the HTML tag whose `id` attribute is "listOfData".
          // Then it appends some new HTML content to the inside of that tag.
          $('#listOfData').append(`<li>${year}: ${carsByYear[year]}`);
        }
      }
    </script>


    <!--
      We've set everything up! All that's left is to load our actual data.
      Let's fetch our JSON data from the Providence Open Data website.
    -->
    <script>
      $.ajax({
        url: "https://data.providenceri.gov/resource/vyz5-ii9r.json",
        data: {
          "$limit" : 1000, // How many records do we want to load?
          // "$$app_token" : "YOUR_TOKEN" // Uncomment this line and replace with your own Providence Open Data token
        }
      }).done(function(data) {
        // When the JSON data finishes loading, this code will get run. What should we do now?
        // Let's call our function to process the data and print it on the page.
        processData(data)
      });
    </script>


    <!--
      A NICE THING TO KNOW:
      Alternately, instead of loading the data from another website, we could just include the JSON blob directly
      in our page. This can be useful if the site that you are loading data from has rate limiting (e.g. "you can
      only load this data 50 times per day!"), or if you want to test your code with a smaller number of records.
      To do this, you would replace the JSON-loading code above with the following:

      <script>
        var data = YOUR_JSON_BLOB_GOES_HERE;
        processData(data);
      </script>
    -->
  </body>
</html>
